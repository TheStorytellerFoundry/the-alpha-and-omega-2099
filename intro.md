_Why do I do it?_ I’ve been asking myself that for a long time.

My footsteps echo in the hollow dark around me.

_What’s the point of my life?_ I don’t know that either.

But I keep walking forward, deeper into the dark.

Maybe I was born too late for anything to matter. My grandfather used to tell me stories about when the world was a beautiful and peaceful place. He and my grandmother had a home in a small, remote village where they grew their own vegetables. I’ve only ever seen vegetables in photos my grandfather hid from the authorities. I don’t even know what a house is, let alone a village. I still struggle to understand the idea of someone owning more than a bed. The only vegetables I know are liquids pumped through tubes into my bloodstream.

“Hey, are you working at this location?”

An unexpected voice interrupts my thoughts. It seems I’m not alone.

“Yeah, didn’t think there was anyone else deployed here.” My voice echoes, heavy with disappointment. It’s nothing personal. It’s just that now I have to split what I find—and my salary—equally with him. The feeling of disappointment is probably mutual. “It’s gotten pretty dark. Let’s take turns using the flashlights. Make sure your sensor is on.”

My colleague nods in agreement, and we move together, pushing deeper into the darkness.
