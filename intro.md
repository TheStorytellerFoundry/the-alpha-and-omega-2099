‘Why do I do it? ‘

I’d been asking myself that for a long time.

My footsteps echo in the hollow dark around me.

‘What’s the point of my life? ‘

I didn’t know that either.

But I keep walking. Forward. Deeper into the dark.

Maybe I was just born too late for anything to matter.

My grandfather used to tell me stories — about when the world was beautiful. Peaceful.

He and my grandma lived in a village. Grew vegetables.

I didn’t even know what a house was, let alone a village.

I still struggle to understand the idea of someone owning more than a bed… Let alone land.

Vegetables? I’ve only ever seen them in confiscated photos my grandfather hid from the authorities.

The only vegetables I know now… Are liquid.

Pumped through tubes and straight into my bloodstream.

“Hey, you are also working this location?”

An unexpected voice interrupted my thoughts. It seems I’m not alone here.

“Yeah, I thought there wasn’t anyone else deployed here…”

My voice echoed, heavy with disappointment.

It’s nothing personal. It’s just now we have to split everything we find evenly, which means half of my salary will be given to him. The feeling was probably mutual.

“Well, it’s gotten pretty dark. Let’s take turns using the flashlights. Make sure your sensor is also on.”

My “colleague” nodded in agreement and we moved together, pushing deeper into the slightly less oppressive darkness.
